Predicting Chemical Biodegradability Using QSAR Data
Overview

This project builds and compares machine learning classification models to predict whether a chemical compound is biodegradable based on molecular descriptors.

The dataset used is the QSAR Biodegradation dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It contains 1055 compounds described by 41 molecular descriptors, with a binary target indicating biodegradable or non-biodegradable.

Data Processing:

-Checked for missing and infinite values

-Verified zero-variance features

-Assessed duplicate rows

-Identified moderate class imbalance (699 non-biodegradable, 356 biodegradable)

-Performed 80:20 train-test split

-Applied z-score normalization using training statistics only to prevent data leakage

-Conducted Pearson correlation analysis to assess feature collinearity

-Retained outliers as QSAR descriptors can contain meaningful extreme values

Models Implemented:

-Logistic Regression

-Support Vector Machine with RBF kernel

Gaussian Naive Bayes

All models were trained on normalized training data and evaluated on a separate test set.

Model Performance
Logistic Regression

Accuracy: 0.882

AUC: 0.920

Balanced sensitivity and specificity

Support Vector Machine (RBF)

Accuracy: 0.872

AUC: 0.920

Similar ranking performance to logistic regression

Naive Bayes

Accuracy: 0.526

AUC: 0.703

Lower performance due to violation of the conditional independence assumption

Key Conclusion

Logistic regression is recommended for this dataset. It achieved high predictive performance while maintaining interpretability, which is important for environmental and regulatory decision-making.
