# Predicting Chemical Biodegradability Using QSAR Data

This project builds and compares machine learning classification models to predict whether a chemical compound is biodegradable based on molecular descriptors.

Biodegradability refers to the ability of a chemical compound to be broken down by microorganisms in the environment. Poor biodegradability can lead to environmental accumulation and increased ecological risk.

The dataset used is the QSAR Biodegradation dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It contains 1055 compounds described by 41 molecular descriptors, with a binary target indicating biodegradable or non-biodegradable.

# Data Processing:

-Checked for missing and infinite values

-Verified zero-variance features

-Assessed duplicate rows

-Identified moderate class imbalance (699 non-biodegradable, 356 biodegradable)

-Performed 80:20 train-test split

-Applied z-score normalization using training statistics only to prevent data leakage

-Conducted Pearson correlation analysis to assess feature collinearity

-Retained outliers as QSAR descriptors can contain meaningful extreme values

# Models Implemented:

Logistic Regression
A linear probabilistic classifier that estimates the probability of a compound being biodegradable based on molecular descriptors.

Support Vector Machine with RBF kernel
A margin-based classifier that uses a nonlinear radial basis function kernel to separate classes in higher-dimensional feature space.

Gaussian Naive Bayes
A probabilistic classifier based on Bayes’ theorem that assumes conditional independence between descriptors.

All models were trained on normalized training data and evaluated on a separate test set.

# Model Performance:

Accuracy measures the proportion of correct predictions.
The ROC curve evaluates the trade-off between true positive rate and false positive rate across different classification thresholds.
AUC (Area Under the Curve) measures the model’s ranking ability independent of a fixed decision threshold.
